# network-traffic
This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to automatically analyze, classify, and secure network traffic. It is designed to improve cybersecurity by detecting known and unknown threats, optimizing performance, and supporting privacy-preserving analysis — even on encrypted traffic.
🔍 AI/ML-Based Network Traffic Classification and Threat Detection
This project applies Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to analyze, classify, and secure network traffic.
It detects threats like DDoS, Port Scans, and even unknown anomalies, while supporting privacy-preserving analysis — even on encrypted traffic using only metadata.

🚀 **Key Features**
 Traffic Classification using supervised learning (Random Forest)

 Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest (unsupervised)

 Performance Optimization using GridSearchCV

 Privacy-Preserving Traffic Analysis using only metadata (no payloads)

 Google Colab Compatible + Modular Python Code

 **Sample Outputs**
   **Traffic Classification Report:**
Accuracy: ~96%
Precision/Recall: > 90% on known attack types

 **Anomaly Detection** (Isolation Forest):
Actual: Benign    → Predicted: Normal
Actual: PortScan  → Predicted: Anomaly

** Privacy-Preserving Detection:**
Accuracy: ~92% using only flow-based metadata (no payload)
